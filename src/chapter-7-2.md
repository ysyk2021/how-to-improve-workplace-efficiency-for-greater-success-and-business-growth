Providing training and education involves ensuring that individuals have the skills and knowledge necessary to effectively communicate within the organization. This can involve training on communication techniques, conflict resolution, and cultural awareness.

By developing effective communication channels, individuals and organizations can achieve greater efficiency and productivity.
